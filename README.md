# 🧠 Amazon Product Review Emotion Analysis

This project focuses on extracting, cleaning, and analyzing **Amazon product reviews** to detect the **emotional tone** behind user feedback using **transformer-based NLP models**.

While traditional sentiment analysis classifies reviews as positive or negative, **emotion analysis** dives deeper — identifying human emotions such as **joy**, **anger**, **sadness**, and more. These insights can help brands better understand their customers and improve products and services.
